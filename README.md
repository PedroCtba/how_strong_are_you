# Powerlifting Data Analysis App

This project is a **Streamlit** application that visualizes and analyzes powerlifting data using the **OpenPowerlifting** dataset. Users can input their lift numbers and compare their performance to others in the same division, weight class, federation, and country. The app provides percentile rankings, visual distributions of lifts, and allows users to filter results by several criteria.

## Features

- **Lift Distribution Visualization**: View the distribution of lifts (squat, bench, deadlift) and total lift values.
- **Percentile Calculation**: See where you rank compared to other lifters.
- **Flexible Filters**: Filter results by gender, weight class, division, federation, equipment, and country. All filters are optional.
- **Language Support**: Choose between English and Portuguese.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For the main application logic.
- **Streamlit**: For the interactive user interface.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and filtering.
- **Plotly**: For creating visualizations (histograms).
- **Parquet**: Used for efficient data storage.
